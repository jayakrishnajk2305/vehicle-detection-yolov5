### `# ðŸš— Vehicle Detection in Video using YOLOv5 and OpenCV`
Detect cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles from video using YOLOv5 and OpenCV. This project demonstrates how deep learning can be used for real-time vehicle detection in traffic surveillance videos.

---

### `## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview`
This project uses the YOLOv5 object detection model to identify and draw bounding boxes around vehicles in a video. It supports detection of common vehicle types and saves the output with annotations for further analysis or visualization.

---

### `## ðŸŽ¯ Objective`
- Detect and label cars, trucks, buses, and motorbikes from a video.
- Display the detection results in real-time.
- Save the processed video with bounding boxes.
- Lay the groundwork for advanced features like counting and tracking.

---

### `## ðŸ§° Technologies Used`
- **Python 3**
- **OpenCV** for video processing and visualization
- **YOLOv5** (PyTorch) for object detection
- **Pre-trained COCO model** to identify common objects, including vehicles

---

### `## ðŸ“¹ Input & Output`
- **Input**: Any `.mp4` traffic video
- **Output**: A new video with bounding boxes around detected vehicles

---

### `## ðŸ§  How YOLOv5 Works`
YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) is a powerful object detection model that identifies objects in images or video in a single pass. This makes it extremely fast and accurate for real-time applications like vehicle detection.

---

### `## ðŸ§ª Sample Classes Detected`
This project focuses on detecting the following COCO classes:
- ðŸš— Car
- ðŸ›µ Motorbike
- ðŸšŒ Bus
- ðŸšš Truck

---

### `## ðŸš€ Getting Started`
Detailed instructions on installing dependencies, running the model, and customizing for your own videos.

---

### `## ðŸ”® Possible Improvements`
- Add object tracking to prevent duplicate counts
- Integrate vehicle speed estimation
- Enhance detection in low-light (night) conditions
- Train on a custom dataset for better accuracy in your environment
